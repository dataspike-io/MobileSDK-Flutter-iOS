# MobileSDK-Flutter-iOS

## Example Project with Integrated API

This repository contains an example iOS project demonstrating how to integrate
**DataspikeMobile SDK** using a Flutter module and how to work with the Dataspike API.

The example covers:
- Embedding a Flutter module into a native iOS application
- Initializing the Dataspike verification flow
- Passing API credentials (`dsApiToken`, `shortId`)
- Handling verification completion via `onVerificationCompleted` callback

The project can be used as a reference implementation for integrating
DataspikeMobile SDK into an existing iOS application.
